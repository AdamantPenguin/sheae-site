# sheae-site

SHEA Entrepreneurs (Super Helpful Enterprise Areas Entrepreneurs) is a pseudo-company, if that's a word, which has a website where I try to learn web design.

## Where is it?

It is hosted at [sheae.atwebpages.com](http://sheae.atwebpages.com/).

## Pages

### /anyapp

This is me testing out my stylesheet. It looks ugly. It also doesn't do anything useful.

### /winshorts

This is a page containing many wonderful shortcuts to features on Windows 10 (tested on version 1909) by using custom protocols like [ms-actioncenter](ms-actioncenter://) which opens Action Centre.

### /material

This is some pre-compiled code that makes a [material design](https://www.material.io) button labelled "THIS BUTTON DOESN'T DO ANYTHING", and it isn't lying. It won't ever be updated, and any pull requests to this will be ignored by Mr Me.

## Contributing

As mentioned above, any pull requests changing any files in /material will be ignored, but if you have any other interesting and useful pages or changes to existing pages then I will consider them and merge them if I think they will make the site better, or help me get better at web design, or fix stupid errors.
